# You are required to write a program to sort the (name, age, height) tuples by ascending order
# where name is string, age and height are numbers. The tuples are input by console. The sort criteria is:
# 1: Sort based on name;
# 2: Then sort based on age;
# 3: Then sort by score.
# The priority is that name > age > score.
